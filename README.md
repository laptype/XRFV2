*(Currently, only data from 3 volunteers are available for access)*

## 📦 Environment Configuration

### 🛠️ Mamba Environment Setup:
Ensure that you are using the **CUDA 11.8** environment.

```bash
# Clone the video-mamba-suite repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenGVLab/video-mamba-suite.git

# Create and activate the environment
conda create -n video-mamba-suite python=3.9
conda activate video-mamba-suite

# Install PyTorch
pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install required dependencies
pip install h5py pandas scipy torchinfo

# Install the requirements from requirement.txt
pip install -r requirement.txt

# Install causal-conv1d
cd causal-conv1d
# If setup.py fails, run the following:
CAUSAL_CONV1D_FORCE_BUILD=TRUE pip install .
cd ..

# Install mamba
cd mamba
python setup.py develop
cd ..
```
⚠️ If you encounter issues while installing `causal-conv1d`, please refer to [this setup issue fix](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/issues/40#issuecomment-1849095898).

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Code:

1. Modify the paths in `basic_config.json` to match your system setup.
2. To **train** the model:
```bash
   python script/train_run.py
```
3. To **test** the model:

Copy the path of the trained model and specify it in `test_run.py` before running the test:

```
   test_model_list = [XXXXX]
```

```bash
   python script/test_run.py
```
